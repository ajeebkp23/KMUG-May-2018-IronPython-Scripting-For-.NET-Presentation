# KMUG-May-2018-IronPython-Scripting-For-.NET-Presentation

This repo contains both code and presentation used in the KMUG May 2018.

To view presentation, just open index.html in a decent browser (After downloading the repo).

Code is in CodeSamples folder. It is working with VS2015 and VS2017. VS2013 is expected to work. Others might have to do some work. One may have to restore Nuget packages before building, by clicking Restore Nuget Packages (Even though VS2017 does this on running or building the project).
